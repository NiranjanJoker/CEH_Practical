This is the easiest method to bruteforce when you have the wordlist.

first intercept the http req for the login form of wordpress website using the burpsuite.


Then move it to the intruder tab. (ctrl +  I)

Then select the payload.

first give clear all.

then select username and click add to set as an payload.
then the same for the password.

set the attack type as cluster bomb

after this, 

Go to the payload tab

select payload set 1:

and add the payload file : which is the worlist.

then the payload set 2:

once all this done. give Start Attack.

this will do all the possible combinations and give you a result of it. analyse it. check for the status code "302".
